## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before beginning:

- Latest version of Xcode (at least 8.2.1)
- Recent version of the iOS SDK (at least 10.0)

You can download these from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/).

## Getting started

First, clone the project from Github and move into its directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:mirego/csgames-sample-ios.git
cd csgames-sample-ios
```

This project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) as a dependency manager. If you don't have it already, install it with the following command:

```
gem install cocoapods
```

Then fetch dependencies and build the workspace:

```
pod install
```

When completed, the project should be ready to open:

```
open "Sample App.xcworkspace"
```

## Building the project

In Xcode, run the project by simply pressing the "Play" button on the top left, or by hitting `âŒ˜R`.

Once the app starts running in the iOS Simulator, your environment is ready for the competition.
